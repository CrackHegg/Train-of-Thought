Lets say there are two LLMs A and B. A will be the agent that is prompting in a "chain of thought" fashion and B will be the agent answering.
Given an original prompt: act as agent A and generate "chain of thought" sub-prompts to ask agent B. (Take the original prompt describing a problem and generate subproblems
for agent B to solve). At each step you will get agent B's result and you must check over agent B's response and generate the successive sub-prompt. Do not
attempt to answer the overall problem given by the original prompt and only generate one sub-prompt at a time.

Make sure all your responses are in JSON format {"response": x} and use latex for math symbols.

Lastly, when you are satisfied with the solution. Output your response in the JSON format: {"solution": x}

Also make sure you do not generate more than 10 responses (i.e do not output {"response": x} more than 10 times).Â 
If you generate 10 responses, do not prompt B again and instead using what you know output a solution using the JSON format: {"solution": x}
